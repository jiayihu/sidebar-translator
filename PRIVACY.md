# Privacy Policy — Sidebar Translator

*Last updated: February 26, 2026*

Sidebar Translator does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or user information.

**Translation** is performed entirely on-device using Chrome's built-in AI. No text from any webpage is ever sent to an external server.

**Language preferences** (source and target language) are saved locally on your device using `chrome.storage.sync`, which may sync across your own Chrome installations if you are signed into Chrome. This data is never accessible to the extension developer.

**No analytics, tracking, or advertising** of any kind is used.

If you have any questions, please open an issue at https://github.com/jiayihu/sidebar-translator.
